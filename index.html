      <h1>Bubbling and capturing example</h1>

      <p>Here's some code that I proposed as an update to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#other_event_concepts">MDN's Introduction to events</a> tutorial.</p>
      <p>UPDATE: My suggestions were accepted and merged with the MDN tutorial on the 25th of November 2021. See <a href="https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/10775">my pull request</a> for more details.</p>

      <p>The iframe below contains the original version of the code example from the tutorial (accessed on the 24th of November 2021). The example contains five nested <code>&ltdiv&gt</code> elements, which run some JavaScript code that reports bubbling and capturing events when one of the elements is clicked. The button runs a function that clears the text output, but the bubbling stage events for the window and the HTML document remain displayed in the log section after this button is clicked.</p>

      <p>Here's the original JavaScript code:</p>
      <iframe src="bubbling-and-capturing-original.js" width="500px" height="600px"></iframe>

      <p>I created an updated version with <code>evt.stopPropagation()</code> added to the <code>clearOutput()</code> function. This means that no messages are left in the log section after the "clear output" button is clicked. This version is displayed in the iframe below:</p>
      <iframe src="bubbling-and-capturing-updated.html" width="500px" height="400px"></iframe>

      <p>I also added some string formatting code to the <code>gphase()</code> function to remove the square brackets and "object" from the log text.</p>

      <p>Here's my updated version of the JavaScript code:</p>
